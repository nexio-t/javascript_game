# JavaScript Hangman Game

> Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

* User initiates game with key press and guesses the disguised word 
* User is restricted to X number of guesses, dependent on word length
* Repeat presses of the same incorrect key won't double count 
* If the user wins, the win counter goes up and win sound plays
* If the user loses, a new game is loaded and lose sound plays
* Remaining: automatically load new word once user "wins" game and eliminate registering of key presses that are non-alphanumeric (e.g., shift, enter, etc.)
